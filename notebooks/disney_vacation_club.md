My appreciation for Disney has grown with age. I love visiting the theme parks. The wonderful experiences at the parks led to the discovery of [Disney Vacation Club](https://disneyvacationclub.disney.go.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and realizing that a membership would make sense financially.

Annual dues is the main variable cost from year to year that I needed to consider before selecting a resort for the base membership. There is public data available for the annual due amount per point, which makes this a great exercise to track trends overtime and predict the potential due amounts in the future.

I am particularly drawn to the Polynesian Resort because of the beautiful Hawaiian Theme and excellent transportation options to the parks. I compared resorts in this notebook to see which ones would make the most financial and personal sense for me. Now I can focus more on enjoying the magic and creating unforgettable memories!
