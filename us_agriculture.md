The goal of this exercise is to produce high-quality data visualizations.

## Background Context

I had the privilege of working with [The Food Project](https://thefoodproject.org/), a non-profit organization committed to building a sustainable, equitable, and accessible food system. I gained valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities of building a community-based food system that promotes environmental sustainability and social change.
